The problem here is that on line 19 we are trying to access a constant defined
in a different class without the namespace resolution operator. Because in this
case each subclass of File has a different value for the FORMAT constant, we'll
need to get the class name of the calling object in order to make sure
we are accessing the correct class' FORMAT constant. We can do this by calling
self.class as seen in line 19
