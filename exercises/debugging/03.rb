ada.teleport_to(-33.89, 151.277)

puts ada.location                   # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts grace.location                 # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts ada.location == grace.location # expected: true
                                    # actual: false

The problem here is that we are comparing custom objects with the Object#== method.
By default, this method will check to see if the two objects being comapred are the
same object in memory. In this case, they are two different location objects, despite
describing the same location. We need to define a custom #== method for these objects 
if we have specific values that we wish to be compared for equality. In this case,
these would be the attributed @longitude and @latitude, as can be seen on line 27
