=begin
The problem with this code came from line 64 (previously private). By defining the
serial_number getter method as private, we are making it available only to the specific
instance of Employee. However, we need this method to be available to _all_ Employee
objects, due to the implementation of Employee#==() on line 55. By changing private
to protected, we make the serial_number getter method available to other Employee
objects which allows us to proceed with the necessary comparison without necessarily
making an Employee's serial number publicly available.
